PyAdmin aims to be an easy and thin alternative to PHPMyAdmin.
It is written in Python and the graphic is realized through wxPython libraries.
It was born as a school project and has been realized by Panzeri Mattia and Locatelli Matteo 
for the high school final graduating exam.

TO DO:
  - Code and Graphic Improvements
  - Import/Export Dialog
  - Ecc..

Any help or suggestion is really appreciated.
